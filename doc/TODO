x switch to SLF4J logging facade so that any kind of logging system can be used with log4jdbc --
  not just log4j

x need a way to report exceptions in the sql timing log as well as the sql that failed and how long it took to fail.

x include ydoc within javadoc

x NEED TO LOOK INTO how to support isJdbcLoggingEnabled method call for Slf4jSpyLogDelegator

o NEED to test & build for jdk 1.5&1.6 and jdbc 4

o  log4layers product?  log4jdbc + servlet layer logging, struts layer logging, json-rpc layer logging, request header dump?

o  configuration that doesn't rely on system properties (jdbc parms?)

o  PostLogProfilerProcessor needs to be able to handle exceptions in log, & needs to be more efficient, also needs command
   line switches to control the thresholds & counts, etc.
