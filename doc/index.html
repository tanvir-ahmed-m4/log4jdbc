<b>log4jdbc</b> is a JDBC driver that can log SQL and/or JDBC calls (and optionally SQL timing information)
for other jdbc drivers using the <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/">log4j</a> 1.2.x logging system.
</p>

<p class="left"><b>2007-04-21:</b> log4jdbc 1.0 has been released!  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=194500&package_id=229335&release_id=502834">Download it</a> and give it a try!</p>

<p class="right"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>
<h2><a name="features"/>features</h2>

<ul class="left">
<li>
  Easy to drop in and use in existing systems, because it's a standard jdbc driver.
  The only other requirement is to have the log4j 1.2.x jar and your jdbc driver for your
  database.
</li>

<li>
  Easy to configure, in most cases all you need to do is change the driver class name
  and prepend "jdbc:log4" to your existing jdbc url, set up your log4j categories and
  you're ready to go!
</li>

<li>
  In the logged output, for prepared statements, the bind arguments are automatically
  inserted into the SQL output.  This greatly Improves readability and debugging for
  many cases.
</li>

<li>
  SQL timing information can be generated to help identify how long SQL statements take
  to run, helping to identify statements that are running too slowly.
</li>

<li>
  SQL connection number information is generated to help identify connection pooling or
  threading problems.
</li>

<li>
  Works with any JDBC 3.0 driver, JDK 1.4 and above, and log4j 1.2.x.
</li>

</ul>
<p>
This jdbc driver can be "dropped in" to log the SQL and jdbc calls of another JDBC driver.

<h2><a name="usage"/>usage</h2>

<ol class="left">

<li><p> Set your jdbc driver class to <code>net.sf.log4jdbc.DriverSpy</code> </p>
    <p>
    The underlying driver that is being spied on in many cases will be loaded automatically
    without any additional configuration.
    </p>
  <p>
    The log4jdbc "spy" driver will try and load the following popular jdbc drivers:
    </p>
  <pre>

        oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver              (oracle)
        com.sybase.jdbc2.jdbc.SybDriver              (sybase)
        net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver             (sourceforge ms sql server driver)
        com.microsoft.jdbc.sqlserver.SQLServerDriver (microsoft ms sql server driver)
        weblogic.jdbc.sqlserver.SQLServerDriver      (weblogic ms sql server driver)
        com.informix.jdbc.IfxDriver                  (informix)
        org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver           (apache derby client/server driver)
        org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver         (apache derby embedded driver)
    </pre>
  <p>
    If you want to use a different underlying jdbc driver that is not already in the above supported list,
    set a system property, log4jdbc.drivers to the class name of the additional driver.  This
    can also be a comma separated list of driver class names.
  </p>
  <p>
    (optional) <code>-Dlog4jdbc.drivers=&lt;driver&gt;[,&lt;driver&gt;...]</code>  If your driver is not one of the common preloaded drivers.
  </p>
</li>
<li><p> Prepend <code>jdbc:log4</code> to the normal jdbc url that you are using.</p>

    <p>For example, if your normal jdbc url is <code>jdbc:derby://localhost:1527//db-derby-10.2.2.0-bin/databases/MyDatabase</code>
    You would change it to:  <code>jdbc:log4jdbc:derby://localhost:1527//db-derby-10.2.2.0-bin/databases/MyDatabase</code> to use the
    log4jdbc spy driver.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure <span class="file">log4jdbc-1.0.jar</span> and the <span class="file">log4j jar</span> (v1.2x) are in
  the classpath, as well as the jar file(s) for the actual jdbc driver that is being spied upon.</p>
  <p>
    Use the following command line options to initialize log4j:
  </p>
  <pre>

    (optional) -Dlog4j.debug
               -Dlog4j.configuration=log4j.xml (make sure that log4j.xml is also in the classpath).
  </pre>
    <p>or alternatively initialize the log4j system in code. </p>
</li>
<li> <p> Set up your log4j logging categories.  There are 4 categories that are used by log4jdbc,
    If all 4 loggers are set to the FATAL level, then log4jdbc will not log anything, and in fact the actual (real)
    connection to the underlying database will be returned by the driver (thus allowing log4jdbc to be installed and
    available without imposing any performance loss).  If any of the 4 logs are set to ERROR or higher, then log4jdbc
    will be activated, wrapping and logging all activity in the jdbc connections returned by the driver.</p>
    <pre>

    Each of these logs can be set at either DEBUG, INFO or ERROR
    DEBUG includes the class name and line number (if available) at which the sql was executed.
    INFO  includes the sql (or other information as applicable)
    ERROR will show the stack traces in the log output when sql exceptions occur.

    jdbc.sqlonly   shows only SQL in the log.  SQL executed within a prepared statement is automatically shown with
                   it's bind arguments replaced with the data bound at that position, for greatly increased readability.

    jdbc.sqltiming shows the SQL, post-execution, including timing statistics on how long the sql took to execute.

    jdbc.audit     Logs ALL jdbc calls except for ResultSets.  This is a very voluminous output, and is not normally
                   needed unless tracking down a specific jdbc problem.

    jdbc.resultset Even more voluminous, because all calls to ResultSet objects are logged.
    </pre>

    <p>Additionally, there is one logger named log4jdbc.debug which is for use with internal debugging of log4jdbc.
    At this time it just prints out information on which underlying drivers were found and not found when the
    spy driver loads.</p>

    <p>In a typical usage scenario, you might turn on only the jdbc.sqlonly logging at INFO level,
    just to view the sql coming out of your program.</p>

    <p>Then if you wanted to view how long each sql statement is taking to execute, you might use jdbc.sqltiming.</p>

    <p>jdbc.audit and jdbc.resultset are used for more in depth diagnosis of what is going on under the hood with jdbc
    as potentially almost every single call to jdbc could be logged (logs can grow very large very quickly with this.)</p>

    <p>See the sample files <a href="log4j.xml">log4j.xml</a> and <a href="log4j.properties">log4j.properties</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adjust debugging options.  When logging at the DEBUG level, the class file and line number (if available) for the
    class that invoked jdbc is logged after each log statement.  This is enormously useful for finding where in the
    code the SQL is generated.  Be careful when using this on a production system because there is a small, but
    potentially significant penalty performance for generating this data on each logging statement.</p>

    <p>In many cases, this call stack data is not very useful because the calling class into log4jdbc is a connection pool,
    object-persistance layer or other layer between log4jdbc and your application code-- but the class file and
    line number information you really are interested in seeing is where in your application the SQL was generated from.</p>

    <p>There are a couple of very useful system properties you can set for log4jdc to help get around this problem.</p>

    <p>
    (optional) <code>-Dlog4jdbc.debug.stack.prefix=&lt;package.prefix&gt;</code>  a String that is the partial (or full) package
       prefix for the package name of your application.  The call stack will be searched down to the first occurence
       of a class that has the matching prefix.  If this is not set, the actual class that called into log4jdbc is used
       in the debug output (in many cases this will be a connection pool class)</p>
