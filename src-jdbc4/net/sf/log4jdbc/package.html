The log4jdbc JDBC driver is a special JDBC driver that delegates all jdbc calls to another jdbc driver, logging the
sql and other useful information in the process.  log4jdbc is dependant on the log4j logging system (verson 1.2.x) but
the code has been written to be logger agnostic and with minor code changes, it could be used with any
logging system.
